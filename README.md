## About The Project

This is a minimalisitc e-commerce site built with ReactJS using react-router-dom for routing and react-redux for state management. Axios is used to fetch data from the [dummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com).

   ```
2. Navigate to the cloned folder and install dependencies:
   ```sh

   npm install
   npm i axios react-router-dom react-redux
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Visit the deployed [link](https://spacepineapple.github.io/just_buy/) to access the website. The website has the following routes:

- `/` - displays the homepage with a carousel, top categories and top deals
- `/shop` - displays the shop page with all the categories and a top deals section highlighting the top deals based on the highest discount percentage
- `/about` - displays the about information of the e-commerce site
- `/contact` - displays information of how to get in contact with the company
- `/category` - combined with various category names, this displays information
  about the products in each category
- `/checkout` - displays the contents of the user's cart and allows them to
  checkout
- `/returns` - displays the returns policy
- `/faq` - displays frequently asked questions and answers to these questions
- `/shipping` - displays shipping information
- `/terms` - displays terms and conditions
- `/thanks` - displayed on completing checkout. Displays a thank you message and
  random quote.

You can navigate between the routes using the links in the header, within the page and footer. There are also various routes to other pages such as the FAQ section, Terms and Conditions section, Returns Policy etc.

## State Management

The app uses `react-redux` and the react-redux-toolkit for state management. The state is split into the following slices:

products - contains a list of all the products
cart - contains the items that have been added to the shopping cart

The state is updated using Redux actions and reducers. A store was created which
maintains the state and regularly writes to local storage to prevent loss of
data. The header contains an indicator of the cart size, which uses the
useSelector hook to update the nav bar indicator in real time as the state of
the cart changes. This hook was also used on the checkout page to update the
page in real time as products are removed.
